Bazel Maven Java Jacoco application
----------------------

In this project I would like to count a JUnit coverage using a Jacoco library based on the existed Maven project [`coverage_with_jacoco`](https://github.com/klymmalakhov/coverage_with_jacoco)   where we are creation a coverage report by Jacoco library.
